<h3 align="center">Tips</h3>

<p align="center">Debugging is the process of finding and reducing defects in a software application or even hardware. Software errors include those that prevent the program from running and those that produce an unexpected result. In this topic your challenge will be to solve bugs in some code separated by levels.
<br>
My tip is: Start with the "Easy" level, if you find it too easy, go to "Medium" and so on, good code!</p>
